Clojurecraft
============

Clojurecraft is a framework for writing Minecraft bots in Clojure.

**It's definitely not ready for actual use yet, but if you want to poke around it has
some very basic functionality.  Just remember that *everything* is subject to
change.**

Check out the :doc:`Quick Start Guide </quickstart>` if you want to poke around.
